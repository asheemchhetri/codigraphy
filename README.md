<dd>To design a responsive tutorial website to help a user to learn following languages:</dd>

</dl>
###### Git Hub

Other languages will be added in timely manner.

Responsive: By responsive I mean that the website is mobile friendly, but then to learn any language a PC is always a better choice.

####Important Notice
Currently the project is in its initial stage, and a lot more features and work is required in it. But if you have any suggestion for me or you think I should implement something different on the website, then please let me know.

#### What is included in this repo?
This repository consists of structure files that are responsible for main layout and its style. I did not include any javaScript or Jquery files with other asset files as they are under cleaning process, as I am trying to clean the code and minimize the memory consumption by them.

#### Would you like to replicate a particular feature from this website in to your own project?
Please contact me if you would like to use any feature from the website into your own project.<br/>

#### What did I use to build this website?
So far I have used following:
  1. HTML/CSS
  2. JavaScript
  3. Jquery
  4. Bootstrap
